## 6. ifr_by_age.csv 

This file was constructed manually from the estimates and confidence intervals published in Table 3 of: Levin, A.T., Hanage, W.P., Owusu-Boaitey, N. et al. Assessing the age specificity of infection fatality rates for COVID-19: systematic review, meta-analysis, and public policy implications. Eur J Epidemiol 35, 1123â€“1138 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-020-00698-1

Each row contains information on the estimated infection fatality rate for a particular age range. The column "age" contains character strings describing the age ranges, in years. "lower" and "upper" contain the lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals, and "middle" contains the central estimate provided in Levin et al.'s table.
